# Learning Management System (Udemy Clone)

## Project Overview
This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) inspired by Udemy, built with Next.js, React, Prisma ORM, Clerk authentication, Stripe payments, Mux video hosting, and MySQL (Aiven) as the database. 

The system allows an admin (teacher) to upload, monetize, and manage courses, while students can browse, enroll, and track their progress.
